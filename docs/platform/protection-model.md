# Platform Protection Model

Platform Protection is included with every eligible transaction. It is funded through the Platform Service Fee and delivered through a regulated third-party insurer.

The platform does not provide insurance advice and is not an insurer.

---

## What Protection Includes
- Solicitor-fee coverage for eligible disputes
- Insurer-managed claims
- Structured dispute escalation
- Neutral platform involvement

---

## How It Works

1. User creates a contract  
2. Platform Service Fee is applied  
3. Platform pays insurer for group policy  
4. Transaction becomes protected  
5. If dispute occurs:  
   - Parties attempt resolution  
   - If unresolved, claim is routed to insurer  
   - Insurer appoints solicitor  
   - Solicitor fees are covered by insurer  

The platform remains financially neutral and legally uninvolved.

- Support without interference

**Protection you can rely on. Structure you can trust.**
