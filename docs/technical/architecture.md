# Platform Architecture

## Overview
The platform is designed as a protected, professional ecosystem for creative and cultural transactions. It combines contract-based workflows, verified profiles, and built-in protection delivered through a third-party insurer.

The architecture prioritises:
- Honesty
- Integrity
- Trust
- Protection
- Cultural alignment
