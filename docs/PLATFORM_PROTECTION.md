# Platform Protection

**Every eligible transaction includes Platform Protection.**

---

## What Is Platform Protection?

Platform Protection is a service provided through a third-party regulated insurer that offers support if a contractual agreement cannot be resolved between parties.

It is **automatically included** in all eligible transactions on the platform.

---

## What's Covered

### Dispute Resolution Support
Access to structured dispute resolution processes when agreements break down.

### Solicitor Fee Coverage
Legal representation costs are covered by the insurer for eligible claims.

### Direct Claims Handling
All claims are managed directly by the regulated insurer, not the platform.

## Key Principles

### You Never Pay Solicitor Fees
The insurer covers legal representation costs for eligible claims.

### The Platform Stays Neutral
We don't take sides. We provide the infrastructure; the insurer handles claims.

### Protection Is Automatic
You don't opt in. If your transaction is eligible, you're protected.

## Making a Claim

If you need to make a claim:

1. **Attempt Resolution First**: Try to resolve the issue directly with the other party
2. **Document Everything**: Keep records of all communication and agreements
3. **Contact Support**: We'll connect you with the insurer
4. **Insurer Takes Over**: They will assess your claim and provide guidance

---

## Legal Boundaries

- Platform Protection is **insurance provided by a regulated third party**
- The platform is **not an insurer** and does not provide insurance
- The platform does **not provide legal advice**
- Users should seek **independent legal counsel** for complex matters
- The insurer makes all **coverage and claims decisions**

---

## Transparency

- We purchase group insurance to protect users
- The cost is built into the Platform Service Fee
- We do not profit from insurance premiums
- The insurer is regulated and independent

---

**Protection you can rely on. Structure you can trust.**
