# Radio Station Governance Framework

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the minimal governance framework for operating a radio station on the platform.  
It is designed to protect the ecosystem while preserving creative freedom and low-friction participation.

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to all users who create, host, or manage a radio station within the app, whether live, scheduled, or pre-recorded.

## 3. Identity and Accountability

- **Real or verified identity:**  
  Hosts must use their real name or a verified creative identity.
- **Accountability:**  
  Hosts are responsible for all content broadcast under their station, including guest content and pre-recorded material.

## 4. Rights and Licensing

- **Responsibility for rights:**  
  Hosts are solely responsible for ensuring they have the necessary rights, licenses, or permissions to broadcast any music, speech, or other media.
- **No unauthorised content:**  
  Hosts must not broadcast content they do not have the right to use.
- **Platform position:**  
  The platform does not act as a rights holder or licensing intermediary for station content.

## 5. Technical Use of the Platform

- **Competent use:**  
  Hosts must be able to operate the broadcasting tools without causing instability or disruption to the platform.
- **Metadata and scheduling:**  
  Hosts should make reasonable efforts to provide accurate show titles, descriptions, and metadata where supported.
- **No circumvention:**  
  Hosts must not attempt to bypass platform systems, inject unsupported players, or interfere with platform tracking or logging.

## 6. Cultural and Behavioural Standards

- **Cultural alignment:**  
  Stations must contribute to a constructive, adult, and culturally respectful environment.
- **Prohibited content:**  
  No hate speech, harassment, incitement, or exploitative content.
- **No low-effort spam:**  
  Stations should not be used for repetitive, low-value, or purely attention-seeking broadcasts.

## 7. Commercial Activity

- **Personal promotion:**  
  Hosts may promote their own work, events, or projects in a reasonable way.
- **Commercial partnerships:**  
  Ads, sponsorships, or paid placements require explicit approval from the platform.
- **Transparency:**  
  Any approved commercial content must be clearly distinguishable from editorial content.

## 8. Consistency and Continuity

- **Minimum commitment:**  
  Hosts should commit to a basic level of consistency (e.g. at least one show per month) unless otherwise agreed.
- **Hiatus or closure:**  
  If a host intends to pause or stop broadcasting, they should notify the platform so slots and resources can be reallocated.

## 9. Enforcement and Removal

- **Breach of framework:**  
  If a host breaches this framework, the platform may pause, restrict, or remove their station.
- **Non-adversarial approach:**  
  The platform aims for clear, calm resolution, but reserves the right to act unilaterally to protect the ecosystem.
- **No entitlement:**  
  Operating a station is a privilege within the platform, not an automatic right.

## 10. Amendments

This framework may evolve over time.  
Material changes will be communicated to active station hosts, and continued use of the platform implies acceptance of updated terms.
