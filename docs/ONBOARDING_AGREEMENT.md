# Radio Station Host Onboarding Agreement

By applying to host a radio station on this platform, you agree to the following terms.  
This agreement is intentionally minimal, adult, and based on trust and accountability.

---

## 1. Identity and Responsibility

I confirm that:

- I am using my real name or a stable, verifiable creative identity.
- I accept full responsibility for all content broadcast on my station, including guest and pre-recorded content.

---

## 2. Rights and Licensing

I understand and agree that:

- I am solely responsible for securing any rights, licenses, or permissions required to broadcast music, speech, or other media.
- I will not broadcast content for which I do not have the necessary rights.
- The platform does not provide or guarantee music or media licensing on my behalf.

---

## 3. Use of Platform Tools

I agree to:

- Use the platform's broadcasting tools as intended, without attempting to bypass or interfere with system behaviour.
- Make reasonable efforts to manage audio quality, levels, and metadata.
- Avoid actions that could destabilise or degrade the platform for other users.

---

## 4. Cultural and Behavioural Standards

I agree that my station will:

- Contribute to a respectful, adult, and culturally constructive environment.
- Not include hate speech, harassment, incitement, or exploitative content.
- Avoid low-effort spam or purely attention-seeking broadcasts with no meaningful value.

---

## 5. Commercial Activity

I understand that:

- I may promote my own work, events, or projects in a reasonable way.
- I must obtain explicit approval from the platform before running ads, sponsorships, or other commercial partnerships.
- Any approved commercial content must be clearly identified as such.

---

## 6. Consistency and Communication

I agree to:

- Aim for a basic level of consistency in my broadcasting schedule (for example, at least one show per month), unless otherwise agreed.
- Inform the platform if I intend to pause or stop broadcasting, so that my slot and resources can be managed appropriately.

---

## 7. Enforcement

I understand that:

- If I breach this agreement or the Radio Station Governance Framework, the platform may pause, restrict, or remove my station.
- Operating a station on this platform is a privilege, not an entitlement.

---

By proceeding with station creation, I confirm that I have read, understood, and agree to this onboarding agreement and the Radio Station Governance Framework.
