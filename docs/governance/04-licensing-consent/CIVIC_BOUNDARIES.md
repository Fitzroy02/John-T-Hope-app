# Civic Boundaries

**Protecting the John T Hope Centre from political capture, commercial exploitation, and external institutional agendas.**

---

## Purpose

The John T Hope Centre operates as a **civic institution** serving the public good.

To maintain this purpose, clear boundaries must exist between:

- **Civic service** — The Centre's educational and safeguarding mission
- **Political influence** — Partisan or ideological capture
- **Commercial interests** — Profit-driven decision-making
- **External institutional agendas** — Pressure from outside organizations

These boundaries are not walls.  
They are **soft guardrails** — protective principles that preserve institutional integrity while allowing ethical partnerships.

---

## Core Principle: Independence

The John T Hope Centre operates independently of:

- Political parties and partisan movements
- Commercial entities and profit-driven organizations
- Ideological pressure groups
- Government agencies seeking to influence curriculum or governance
- External institutions with conflicting missions

**Independence does not mean isolation.**

The Centre can engage with external partners — but only under conditions that preserve neutrality, safeguarding, and institutional integrity.

## Boundary 1: Civic Service vs. Political Influence

### What Is Civic Service?

Civic service is:
- Education grounded in ethical reasoning
- Protection of human dignity
- Long-term stewardship of knowledge
- Neutrality across political and cultural divides
- Service to the public good across generations

Civic service is **non-partisan by design**.

### What Is Political Influence?

Political influence is:
- Pressure to align with partisan positions
- Curriculum shaped by electoral cycles
- Funding conditional on political support
- Ideological capture by political movements
- Governance decisions driven by political expediency

**The Centre rejects political influence.**

### Boundary Principles

- **No political funding** — The Centre does not accept funding from political parties, campaigns, or partisan organizations
- **No political endorsements** — The Centre does not endorse candidates, parties, or political movements
- **No curriculum shaped by politics** — The 10-Year Political Buffer Rule protects curriculum from political capture
- **No political use of Centre materials** — Centre resources cannot be used for political campaigning or partisan purposes

**Exception:** Civic education (e.g., how government works, history of democratic institutions) is permissible and encouraged — but must remain balanced, age-appropriate, and non-partisan.

## Boundary 2: Civic Service vs. Commercial Interests

### What Is Civic Service?

Civic service is:
- Non-profit mission
- No commercial incentives in decision-making
- Ethical stewardship of resources
- Trust-based relationships with learners and families
- Long-term public good over short-term profit

**The Centre is not a business.**

### What Is Commercial Interest?

Commercial interest is:
- Profit-driven decision-making
- Monetization of user data
- Advertising or sponsorship arrangements
- Curriculum shaped by commercial partnerships
- Governance influenced by financial incentives

**The Centre rejects commercial exploitation.**

### Boundary Principles

- **No commercial sponsorship** — The Centre does not accept sponsorship from corporations or commercial entities
- **No advertising** — No advertisements or promotional content in Centre materials or platforms
- **No sale of user data** — User data is never sold, shared for profit, or exploited commercially
- **No commercial curriculum influence** — Curriculum is not shaped by corporate partnerships or commercial interests
- **No profit-driven governance** — Governance decisions prioritize public good, not financial return

**Exception:** Minimal administrative fees to cover operational costs are permissible — but must be transparent, non-exploitative, and subject to governance oversight.

## Boundary 3: Civic Service vs. External Institutional Agendas

### What Is Civic Service?

Civic service is:
- Independent governance
- Mission-driven decision-making

### What Are External Institutional Agendas?

External institutional agendas are:

- Conditional partnerships that compromise institutional integrity

**The Centre resists external capture.**

### Boundary Principles

- **No curriculum influence from ideological groups** — Curriculum is developed independently, not outsourced to advocacy organizations
- **No governance capture** — Governing bodies are not subject to external appointment or control
- **No mission drift** — The Centre's purpose is not redefined by external pressures

**Exception:** Ethical partnerships with aligned institutions (see "Permitted Partnerships" below) are permissible — but only under conditions that preserve institutional autonomy.
