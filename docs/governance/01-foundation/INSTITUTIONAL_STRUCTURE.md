## Relationships Between Governing Bodies

### Distributed Authority
No single body holds unchecked power. Each governing body has a specific domain of responsibility.

### Collaborative Oversight
When decisions cross domains (e.g., a curriculum change with safeguarding implications), governing bodies collaborate through documented review processes.

### Constitutional Accountability
All governing bodies are accountable to the Constitution. No body may act in ways that contradict foundational principles.

---

## Constitutional Amendments

The Constitution is a **living document**.

It may be amended through transparent, documented processes that preserve institutional authorship and accountability.

### Amendment Requirements

An amendment to the Constitution requires:

#### 1. Written Justification
The amendment must include:
- A clear statement of purpose
- An explanation of why the existing Constitution is insufficient
- An analysis of potential risks and benefits
- A rationale for why the amendment serves the long-term public good

#### 2. Clear Authorship
The amendment must identify:
- Who is proposing the amendment
- Which governing body (or bodies) reviewed it
- Who approved the amendment

#### 3. Review by Relevant Governing Bodies
The amendment must be reviewed by:
- The governing body (or bodies) whose mandate is affected by the amendment
- Any other body with a legitimate interest in the amendment

#### 4. Public Documentation of Changes
The amendment must be:
- Publicly documented with a clear record of what changed
- Published with a rationale and authorship
- Preserved in the institutional archive for future reference

---

## Amendment Process (High-Level)

1. **Proposal** — A written amendment proposal is submitted to the appropriate governing body.
2. **Review** — The governing body reviews the proposal against constitutional principles.
3. **Consultation** — If the amendment affects multiple domains, relevant bodies are consulted.
4. **Approval** — The governing body approves, rejects, or requests revisions.
5. **Documentation** — If approved, the amendment is publicly documented with clear authorship and rationale.
6. **Implementation** — The amended Constitution is published and becomes binding.

---

## What Amendments Cannot Do

Amendments are **not** permitted to:
- Compromise the safety or dignity of children or vulnerable individuals
- Introduce commercial motives or conflicts of interest
- Weaken the 10-Year Political Buffer Rule
- Centralize authority without clear justification
- Obscure accountability or traceability
- Violate any of the six foundational principles

If an amendment would do any of these things, it is **constitutionally impermissible**, regardless of procedural compliance.

---

## Evolution Without Erosion

The amendment process is designed to allow **evolution without erosion**.

The Constitution can adapt to future challenges, but it cannot be diluted, captured, or corrupted.

This ensures:
- **Stability** — The core identity and principles endure
- **Flexibility** — The institution can respond to unforeseen needs
- **Accountability** — Every change is documented and attributed
- **Integrity** — The institution remains true to its mission
