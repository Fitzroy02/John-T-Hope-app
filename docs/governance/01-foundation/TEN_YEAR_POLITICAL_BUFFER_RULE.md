# The 10-Year Political Buffer Rule

**A principle of stability, neutrality, and protection from contemporary political pressure.**

---

## The Rule

No curriculum, policy, or guidance produced by the John T Hope Centre may be influenced by political events, controversies, or narratives less than **ten years old**.

---

## Purpose

The 10-Year Political Buffer Rule exists to:

### 1. Ensure Stability
The curriculum is not subject to the volatility of contemporary politics.

### 2. Reduce Volatility
Institutional decisions are insulated from transient political pressures and cultural movements.

### 3. Protect Learners from Contemporary Pressure
Children and families are shielded from partisan influence and ideological recruitment.

### 4. Maintain Institutional Neutrality
The Centre does not become a tool of any political movement, party, or faction.

### 5. Allow Historical Perspective
Events and ideas are examined with scholarly distance, not immediate emotional reaction.

---

## Scope

The 10-Year Political Buffer Rule applies to:
- **Curriculum content** — What is taught, how it is taught
- **Policy decisions** — Institutional rules and frameworks
- **Guidance documents** — Recommendations to learners, families, or instructors
- **Public communications** — Statements made on behalf of the Centre

The rule does **not** prevent:
- Teaching about historical political events (more than 10 years old)
- Teaching political theory, civics, or systems of governance
- Discussing enduring political principles (democracy, justice, rights)
- Acknowledging that contemporary issues exist

---

## Examples

### Permitted
- Teaching the history of the civil rights movement (1950s-1960s)
- Discussing the structure of democratic governance
- Exploring political philosophy (e.g., Locke, Mill, Rawls)
- Teaching the history of the 2008 financial crisis (after 2018)

### Not Permitted
- Curriculum shaped by events from the last 10 years
- Policies influenced by contemporary political controversies
- Guidance documents responding to recent political movements
- Public statements aligned with current political campaigns

---

## Why Ten Years?

Ten years is long enough to:
- Allow emotions to settle
- Enable scholarly consensus to form
- Provide historical perspective
- Reduce the risk of partisan capture

Ten years is short enough to:
- Keep the curriculum relevant
- Teach recent history responsibly
- Acknowledge the evolution of society

---

## Enforcement

The 10-Year Political Buffer Rule is a **principle**, not a mechanical filter.

Enforcement is through:
- **Curriculum Council review** — Ensures curriculum aligns with the rule
- **Safeguarding Board oversight** — Protects learners from political pressure
- **Transparent governance** — Decisions are documented and auditable

(Detailed enforcement mechanisms are introduced in PR 1C: Curriculum Governance.)

---

## Exceptions

There are **no exceptions** to the 10-Year Political Buffer Rule for curriculum content.

However:
- **Operational decisions** (e.g., data privacy laws, technology standards) may respond to contemporary requirements without violating the rule.
- **Safeguarding protocols** must adapt to emerging threats, even if recent.

When in doubt, ask:
- Does this serve the learner or the institution's political image?
- Would this decision hold if political winds shift?
- Can this be justified ten years from now?

---

## Rationale

The 10-Year Political Buffer Rule is not about avoiding difficult topics.  
It is about **teaching them responsibly**.

Contemporary political events are often:
- Emotionally charged
- Factually incomplete
- Subject to partisan distortion
- Instrumentalized for recruitment

By waiting ten years, the Centre ensures:
- Clearer perspective
- More reliable information
- Less partisan contamination
- Greater protection for learners

---

## Long-Term Impact

The 10-Year Political Buffer Rule ensures that:
- The Centre remains trusted across political divides
- Learners are taught to think, not told what to think
- The institution endures beyond election cycles
- Families from all backgrounds feel safe engaging with the Centre

**This rule protects the institution.**  
**This rule protects the learner.**  
**This rule ensures neutrality across generations.**
