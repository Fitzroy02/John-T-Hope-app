# Instructor Code of Conduct

## Overview

Instructors are custodians of knowledge and guardians of learner safety. This Code defines the minimum ethical standards required for anyone delivering content under the Centre's identity.

This Code is non-negotiable. It protects learners, maintains institutional integrity, and ensures that education is delivered with care, clarity, and ethical discipline.
