# Curriculum Council Mandate

## Overview

The **Curriculum Council** is the Centre's academic governance body. It ensures that all learning materials are safe, ethical, age-appropriate, and aligned with the Centre's principles of neutrality and safeguarding.

This mandate defines the Council's responsibilities, independence, and guiding philosophy.

---

## 1. Purpose

The Council exists to ensure that all curricula and learning pathways are:

- **age-appropriate** — matched to cognitive development and emotional maturity
- **ethically framed** — presented with clarity, balance, and integrity
- **neutral** — free from political, religious, or ideological persuasion
- **aligned with safeguarding principles** — protective of learner wellbeing
- **authored with transparency** — traceable, accountable, and documented

The Council does not create curriculum content. It governs *how* curriculum is developed, reviewed, and delivered.

---

## 2. Responsibilities

The Curriculum Council is responsible for:

### 2.1 Curriculum Approval
- Reviewing and approving all curricula and learning pathways before release
- Ensuring alignment with the Centre's educational philosophy
- Verifying age-tier appropriateness

### 2.2 Age-Tier Boundaries
- Defining and maintaining the Age-Tier Framework
- Adjusting tier boundaries based on developmental research and safeguarding advisories
- Ensuring cognitive load and emotional resilience are appropriately matched

### 2.3 Sensitive Content Review
- Reviewing contested, sensitive, or potentially harmful content
- Applying the 10-Year Political Buffer Rule to contemporary controversies
- Coordinating with the Safeguarding Board on risk-sensitive material

### 2.4 Neutrality Enforcement
- Ensuring curriculum avoids ideological persuasion
- Verifying balanced framing of contested topics
- Distinguishing fact, interpretation, and opinion

### 2.5 Authorship & Accountability
- Maintaining curriculum authorship records
- Ensuring all instructional content includes clear authorship, versioning, and review status
- Tracking curriculum revisions and updates

### 2.6 Safeguarding Coordination
- Collaborating with the Safeguarding Board on content that may pose risk
- Ensuring parental consent requirements are embedded where appropriate
- Escalating safeguarding concerns immediately

---

## 3. Independence

The Council operates independently from:

- **political influence** — no external political party or movement may shape curriculum
- **commercial interests** — curriculum is not influenced by sponsors or advertisers
- **external ideological agendas** — the Council resists capture by any single worldview

This independence is critical to maintaining the Centre's integrity and trustworthiness.

---

## 4. Soft Guardrail Principle

The Council sets **direction**, not dogma.

It defines boundaries that protect learners while allowing future councils to adapt content responsibly as:

- cultural contexts shift
- developmental research advances
- safeguarding advisories evolve

The Council's role is to establish **principles**, not prescriptions. This ensures the framework remains flexible, future-proof, and resilient to changing needs.

---

## 5. Decision-Making Framework

### 5.1 Consensus-First
The Council operates by consensus wherever possible, ensuring:

- diverse perspectives are heard
- decisions are documented with clear rationale
- transparency is maintained

### 5.2 Escalation
When consensus cannot be reached:

- the matter is escalated to the Safeguarding Board (for safeguarding concerns)
- the matter is escalated to the CIC Board (for governance concerns)
- the decision is documented with dissenting views

### 5.3 Review Cycle
Curriculum decisions are reviewed:

- annually
- upon significant changes in developmental research
- when safeguarding advisories are issued
- when community feedback raises valid concerns

---

## 6. Membership

The Council is composed of:

- **Educational experts** — with experience in pedagogy, child development, and instructional design
- **Safeguarding specialists** — with expertise in child protection and risk assessment
- **Subject matter experts** — with domain knowledge relevant to the curricula under review
- **Community representatives** — ensuring diverse perspectives and lived experiences

Membership terms and appointment processes are defined in the Centre's governance framework.

---

## 7. Relationship to Other Governance Bodies

The Curriculum Council works alongside:

- **Safeguarding Board** — on content that poses risk or requires parental consent
- **CIC Board** — on strategic alignment and resource allocation
- **Instructor Teams** — on practical implementation and delivery

The Council does not supersede these bodies but collaborates to ensure holistic governance.

---

## 8. Authority Boundaries

The Council may:

- approve or reject curricula
- request revisions to content
- define age-tier boundaries
- escalate safeguarding concerns

The Council may not:

- bypass the Safeguarding Board on risk-sensitive content
- override the CIC Board on governance or resource decisions
- create curriculum content directly (it governs, it does not author)

---

## 9. Transparency & Accountability

All Council decisions are:

- documented with clear rationale
- published for community review (where appropriate)
- subject to annual audit

This ensures the Council remains accountable and trustworthy.
