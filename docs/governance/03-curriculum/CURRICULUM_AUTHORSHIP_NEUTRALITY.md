# Curriculum Authorship & Neutrality Guardrails

## Overview

Curriculum must be authored with clarity, neutrality, contextual framing, age-appropriate scaffolding, and safeguarding alignment.

This document defines the principles and practices that ensure curriculum is trustworthy, balanced, and ethically sound.

---

## 1. Purpose

These guardrails exist to ensure that:

- curriculum is free from ideological persuasion
- contested topics are presented with balanced framing
- learners can distinguish fact from interpretation and opinion
- content is age-appropriate and cognitively accessible
- safeguarding principles are embedded throughout

These guardrails protect learners and maintain institutional integrity.

---

## 2. Neutrality Requirements

### 2.1 Avoid Contemporary Political Controversies

Curriculum must adhere to the **10-Year Political Buffer Rule**:

- content must not engage with contemporary political controversies less than 10 years old
- this buffer allows time for perspective, evidence, and nuance to emerge
- it protects learners from being drawn into partisan debates

**Example:**  
A 2027 curriculum should not engage with political controversies from 2017 onward.

**Exception:**  
Historical events with settled consensus (e.g., major wars, human rights milestones) may be included with appropriate framing.

### 2.2 Present Contested Topics with Balanced Framing

When presenting contested topics, curriculum must:

- acknowledge multiple perspectives
- avoid privileging one interpretation over others
- distinguish between dominant narratives and minority viewpoints
- provide learners with tools to form their own informed views

**Example:**  
When teaching about economic systems, curriculum should present capitalism, socialism, and mixed economies with balanced analysis, not ideological preference.

### 2.3 Distinguish Between Fact, Interpretation, and Opinion

Curriculum must clearly label:

- **fact** — verifiable, evidence-based claims
- **interpretation** — one lens among many for understanding facts
- **opinion** — personal or cultural perspectives

**Example:**  
- Fact: "World War II ended in 1945."
- Interpretation: "World War II reshaped global power dynamics."
- Opinion: "World War II was the most important event of the 20th century."

### 2.4 Avoid Ideological Persuasion

Curriculum must not:

- present one worldview as inherently superior
- use emotional appeals to shape beliefs
- embed persuasive design to steer learners toward specific conclusions
- conflate institutional voice with ideological advocacy

Curriculum educates; it does not indoctrinate.

---

## 3. Clarity Requirements

### 3.1 Precision in Language
Curriculum must:

- use clear, accessible language
- avoid jargon or ambiguity that could mislead
- define terms explicitly
- provide examples to clarify abstract concepts

### 3.2 Structured Scaffolding
Curriculum must:

- build from foundational to advanced concepts
- provide cognitive support for complex ideas
- adapt to learner readiness
- include checkpoints for understanding

### 3.3 Contextual Framing
Curriculum must:

- provide historical, cultural, and social context
- situate content within broader frameworks
- avoid decontextualized presentation that distorts meaning

---

## 4. Sensitive Content Handling

### 4.1 Age-Tier Review
Sensitive topics must be reviewed by the Curriculum Council to ensure:

- cognitive appropriateness
- emotional resilience alignment
- safeguarding compliance

### 4.2 Safeguarding Review
Content that may pose risk must be reviewed by the Safeguarding Board to ensure:

- learner safety
- appropriate boundaries
- escalation protocols

### 4.3 Parental Consent
Certain sensitive topics require:

- advance disclosure to parents or guardians
- opt-in consent mechanisms
- clear explanation of content nature

See [Consent Status Schema](../schemas/consent_status.schema.json) for implementation details.

### 4.4 Contextual Framing for Sensitive Topics
Sensitive content must:

- be introduced with care and preparation
- provide emotional support resources
- allow learners to opt out if distressed
- avoid graphic or gratuitous presentation

**Example:**  
A lesson on historical conflict must focus on causes, consequences, and lessons learned — not on graphic violence or trauma.

- the decision is documented with clear rationale

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement

- **Safeguarding Board** — which assesses risk and ensures learner safety
- **Instructor Code of Conduct** — which governs how content is delivered

Authors are supported by and accountable to these bodies.
