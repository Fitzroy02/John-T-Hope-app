# Curriculum Governance Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the Centre's pedagogical spine — the frameworks and principles that govern how curriculum is created, reviewed, and delivered.

These documents define **how** curriculum is governed, not **what** curriculum contains. They ensure that learning is safe, age-appropriate, neutral, and ethically delivered.

## Documents

### [Curriculum Council Mandate](CURRICULUM_COUNCIL_MANDATE.md)
Establishes the Centre's academic governance body responsible for:
- Approving curricula and learning pathways
- Defining age-tier boundaries
- Reviewing sensitive content
- Ensuring neutrality and safeguarding compliance

### [Age-Tier Framework](AGE_TIER_FRAMEWORK.md)
Defines the principles and schema for matching content to learners' cognitive development, emotional maturity, and safeguarding needs.

Includes the [Age Tier Schema](../schemas/age_tier.schema.json) specification.

### [Instructor Code of Conduct](INSTRUCTOR_CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
Establishes ethical standards for anyone delivering content under the Centre's identity, including:
- Core duties and responsibilities
- Prohibited practices
- Authorship and accountability requirements

### [Curriculum Authorship & Neutrality](CURRICULUM_AUTHORSHIP_NEUTRALITY.md)
Defines guardrails for curriculum creation, including:
- Neutrality requirements (10-Year Political Buffer Rule)
- Sensitive content handling
- Authorship standards
- Quality assurance processes

## Related Schemas

- [Age Tier Schema](../schemas/age_tier.schema.json) — JSON schema for age-tier classification
- [Consent Status Schema](../schemas/consent_status.schema.json) — JSON schema for tracking learner consent

## Principles

These documents embody several core principles:

1. **Principle-Based, Not Prescriptive** — They provide guidance and boundaries, not rigid rules
2. **Future-Proof** — They're designed to adapt as knowledge, culture, and safeguarding standards evolve
3. **Pedagogically Sound** — They prioritize learner wellbeing and cognitive development
4. **Ethically Disciplined** — They maintain neutrality and protect against manipulation
5. **Transparent & Accountable** — They ensure traceability and institutional integrity

---

## Scope

### This framework covers:
- How curriculum is governed
- Who approves curriculum
- What ethical standards apply to instruction
- How age-appropriateness is determined
- How consent is tracked and respected

### This framework does NOT cover:
- Specific domain curricula (Healthcare, Education, etc.)
- Lesson plans or assessment frameworks
- Licensing agreements
- Technical implementation of consent workflows

Those will be addressed in subsequent documentation (PR 1D and domain-specific PRs).
