# Age-Tiered Educational Delivery

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the four age tiers used to structure educational content delivery.  
Each tier corresponds to established developmental stages and learning capabilities.

## 2. Overview

Educational content is delivered through a tiered framework that protects younger learners from inappropriate material while enabling older learners to engage with complex topics responsibly.

## 3. The Four Tiers

### Tier 1: Ages 5–8 (Early Primary)

**Developmental Focus:**  
Foundation building, basic literacy and numeracy, emotional regulation, cooperation, and safety awareness.

**Learning Areas:**
- Basic reading and writing
- Fundamental arithmetic
- Social skills and cooperation
- Personal safety and boundaries
- Creative expression (art, music, storytelling)
- Physical coordination and play

**Content Restrictions:**
- No political content
- No identity politics or contested social issues
- No sexual education
- No exposure to violence, death, or trauma
- No religious instruction beyond cultural literacy

**Delivery Format:**
- Supervised learning environments only
- No unsupervised digital interaction
- Parent-visible activity logs

**Consent Requirements:**
- Parental consent for platform participation
- No additional consent required for core curriculum

---

### Tier 2: Ages 9–12 (Late Primary)

**Developmental Focus:**  
Foundational subject knowledge, critical thinking basics, digital safety, body literacy, and responsible independence.

**Learning Areas:**
- Core subjects: literacy, numeracy, science, history, geography
- Introduction to critical thinking and logical reasoning
- Digital citizenship and online safety
- Age-appropriate body literacy (hygiene, puberty basics)
- Collaboration and teamwork skills
- Introduction to arts and humanities

**Content Restrictions:**
- No political ideologies or party politics
- No graphic or explicit sexual content
- No adult themes (violence, substance use, trauma)
- Identity and social topics presented descriptively, not morally
- Contemporary controversies avoided unless historically contextualised

**Delivery Format:**
- Blended supervised and semi-independent learning
- Instructor interactions logged and visible
- Parental oversight encouraged

**Consent Requirements:**
- Parental consent required for sensitive topics:
  - Puberty education
  - Body literacy modules
  - Any content flagged as "moderate sensitivity"

---

### Tier 3: Ages 13–15 (Early Secondary)

**Developmental Focus:**  
Deeper subject exploration, civic literacy, media literacy, health awareness, and developing critical autonomy.

**Learning Areas:**
- Advanced core subjects with greater depth
- Civic education: governance systems, rights, responsibilities
- Media literacy: recognising bias, evaluating sources, understanding persuasion
- Health education: mental health, relationships, body autonomy
- Environmental and global awareness
- Preparation for independent research and study

**Content Restrictions:**
- Political systems taught neutrally; ideologies not advocated
- Sensitive topics (sexuality, identity, religion) presented with multiple perspectives
- No graphic violence or explicit sexual content
- Controversial subjects require contextual framing

**Delivery Format:**
- Largely independent learning with instructor support
- Interaction logs maintained
- Dual review process for sensitive modules

**Consent Requirements:**
- Parental consent required for high-sensitivity modules:
  - Sexual health education
  - Religion and ethics modules
  - Contemporary controversies with moral dimensions

---

### Tier 4: Ages 16–18 (Late Secondary)

**Developmental Focus:**  
Advanced subject mastery, civic responsibility, global awareness, career preparation, and autonomous learning.

**Learning Areas:**
- Specialised academic subjects
- Civic responsibility and political literacy (systems, ideologies, critical analysis)
- Global issues: geopolitics, economics, sustainability
- Career pathways and vocational training
- Advanced critical thinking and research skills
- Ethics, philosophy, and moral reasoning

**Content Restrictions:**
- Sensitive content allowed with appropriate framing and context
- Political ideologies taught critically, not advocated
- Strict neutrality maintained on contested issues
- Graphic or traumatic content requires advance warning

**Delivery Format:**
- Independent learning with minimal supervision
- Instructor interactions logged but less restricted
- Learner autonomy respected

**Consent Requirements:**
- Parental notification (not explicit consent) for high-sensitivity modules
- Learners may access sensitive content with contextual framing
- Opt-out mechanism available for parents

---

## 4. Tier Boundaries and Flexibility

### Default Age Mapping
Learners are assigned to tiers based on chronological age by default.

### Parental Adjustment
Parents may request their child be moved to a lower tier for additional protection.  
Moving to a higher tier requires platform review and parental consent.

### Content Escalation
If a module contains material typically reserved for a higher tier, explicit consent and warnings are required before access.

---

## 5. Cross-Tier Principles

Across all tiers, the following apply:
- Evidence-informed content
- Transparent authorship
- Safeguarding-aligned delivery
- Non-partisan and non-ideological framing
- Respect for parental authority

---

## 6. Review and Updates

This tiered framework is reviewed:
- Annually
- Upon significant curriculum changes
- When new developmental research emerges

---

**This structure protects the young while respecting the maturing autonomy of older learners.**
