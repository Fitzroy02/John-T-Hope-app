# Consent Scenarios in Education

## 1. Purpose

This document provides concrete examples of how parental consent operates across different age tiers and content types.  
It demonstrates the practical application of consent principles in educational delivery.

## 2. Overview

Consent is tiered, contextual, and respect-based.  
Younger learners require more explicit parental consent; older learners are granted increasing autonomy, with parental notification rather than approval.

## Scenario A: Puberty Education (Tier 2, Ages 9–12)

### Context
A learning module covering physical changes during puberty, including body development, hygiene, and emotional changes.

### Sensitivity Level
**Moderate** — involves body literacy and developmental topics that some parents may wish to handle personally.

### Consent Process

#### Step 1: Advance Notification
Parents receive a detailed description of the module content, learning objectives, and materials used, at least **two weeks** before delivery.

#### Step 2: Consent Request
Parents are asked to **actively opt in** by providing explicit consent via the platform.

**Consent Form Language:**
> "This module covers puberty, including physical and emotional changes. It is designed to be age-appropriate, factual, and supportive. If you prefer to deliver this education at home, you may opt out. If you consent, your child will access the module with instructor support."

#### Step 3: Alternative Provision
Parents who decline consent are offered:
- A take-home resource pack
- A parent-child discussion guide
- Access to external resources

#### Step 4: Delivery
Only learners with active parental consent access the module.  
Interactions are logged, and parents receive a summary of completion.

## Scenario B: Media Literacy (Tier 3, Ages 13–15)

### Context
A learning module on recognising bias and persuasion in media, using examples from news coverage of recent events (e.g., political campaigns, social movements).

### Sensitivity Level
**Moderate to High** — involves contemporary issues that may be politically or culturally contested.

### Consent Process

#### Step 1: Advance Notification
Parents receive an overview of the module, including examples of media sources and topics to be analysed.

#### Step 2: Consent Request
Parents are asked to **opt in or acknowledge** the module.

**Consent Form Language:**
> "This module teaches critical media literacy by analysing real-world news coverage. Examples may include political events, social movements, and contested issues. The focus is on analytical skills, not advocacy. If you have concerns, please contact us."

#### Step 3: Dual Review
The module undergoes:
- A **neutrality review** to ensure balanced framing
- A **safeguarding review** to confirm age-appropriateness

#### Step 4: Delivery
Learners access the module with instructor guidance.  
Parents receive a summary of topics covered and may request additional context.

## Scenario C: Sexual Health Education (Tier 4, Ages 16–18)

### Context
A comprehensive sexual health module covering consent, contraception, sexually transmitted infections, healthy relationships, and sexual orientation.

### Sensitivity Level
**High** — involves explicit sexual health information that some parents may find inappropriate or prefer to handle differently.

### Consent Process

#### Step 1: Advance Notification
Parents receive detailed module content, including topics, resources, and external links.

**Notification Language:**
> "Your child will soon have access to a sexual health module designed for ages 16–18. This module covers consent, contraception, STIs, and healthy relationships. It is evidence-based and non-judgmental. If you have concerns, you may opt your child out."

#### Step 2: Opt-Out Window
Parents have **two weeks** to actively opt out.  
Silence is interpreted as consent in Tier 4 (unlike Tier 2, where silence is non-consent).

#### Step 3: Learner Autonomy
Learners aged 16–18 may access the module independently if parents do not opt out.  
They are informed that they can pause or skip sections if they feel uncomfortable.

#### Step 4: Delivery
Module is delivered with:
- Clear content warnings
- Links to support resources (counselling, safeguarding contacts)
- Anonymised feedback mechanism

#### Step 5: Post-Access Summary
Parents receive a summary confirming their child accessed the module, without detailing specific interactions.

## 4. General Consent Principles

### Opt-In vs. Opt-Out

| **Tier** | **Consent Model** | **Rationale** |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Tier 1 (5–8) | **Opt-In Required** | Developmental vulnerability; parental control prioritised |
| Tier 2 (9–12) | **Opt-In Required** | Sensitive topics require explicit approval |
| Tier 3 (13–15) | **Opt-In or Acknowledgment** | Balancing protection with increasing autonomy |
| Tier 4 (16–18) | **Opt-Out Available** | Learner autonomy respected; parental notification maintained |

### Transparency
- All consent requests include full module content descriptions
- Parents can preview materials before consenting
- Consent can be withdrawn at any time

### Flexibility
- Parents may request alternative materials or home-based education
- Consent is not punitive; opting out does not disadvantage the learner

## 5. Review and Escalation

If a parent:
- Raises concerns about a module after consent
- Believes content exceeded the described scope
- Reports a safeguarding issue

The platform:
- Investigates immediately
- Suspends the module if necessary
- Provides a full report to the parent
- Reviews the consent process for improvements

---

**Consent is not bureaucracy. It is respect.**
