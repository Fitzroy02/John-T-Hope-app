# Classroom and Virtual Learning Governance

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes the governance requirements for instructors, classroom management, and virtual learning environments.  
It ensures safeguarding, accountability, and professional boundaries are maintained in all educational interactions.

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to:
- All instructors, tutors, and educators operating on the platform
- Live virtual classrooms, recorded sessions, and asynchronous learning environments
- One-to-one tutoring, small group sessions, and large cohort teaching

---

## 3. Governance Requirements

### 3.1 Safeguarding Visibility

**Principle:** All interactions between instructors and learners must be visible, logged, and auditable.

**Implementation:**
- No private or unmonitored communication channels between instructors and learners
- All messaging, video calls, and content sharing occur within the platform's logged environment
- Parents and platform administrators have access to interaction logs upon request
- Real-time safeguarding alerts for flagged keywords, behaviours, or patterns

**Prohibited:**
- Direct messaging via external platforms (WhatsApp, email, social media)
- Off-platform tutoring sessions without parental consent and platform notification
- Deletion or editing of interaction logs by instructors

---

### 3.2 Interaction Logging

**Principle:** Every instructor-learner interaction is logged and stored securely for safeguarding and quality assurance.

**Logged Data:**
- Timestamp and duration of interaction
- Interaction type (question, response, feedback, flag)
- Module or lesson context
- Instructor and learner identifiers (anonymised for analytics)

**Retention:**
- Logs are retained for **7 years** from the date of the interaction
- Logs are accessible to parents, safeguarding officers, and platform administrators
- Learners aged 16+ may request access to their own logs

**Use Cases:**
- Safeguarding investigations
- Instructor performance reviews
- Content quality audits
- Parental oversight

---

### 3.3 Age-Tier Enforcement

**Principle:** Instructors must respect age-tier boundaries and cannot deliver content inappropriate for a learner's tier.

**Requirements:**
- Instructors are trained on age-tier principles and restrictions
- Platform systems prevent delivery of higher-tier content to lower-tier learners without explicit consent
- Instructors must flag any content that may exceed tier boundaries for review

**Violations:**
- Delivering Tier 3 content to Tier 1 learners without consent
- Exposing learners to politically charged material outside the approved curriculum
- Overriding parental opt-outs or consent requirements

**Consequences:**
- First breach: warning and retraining
- Repeated breaches: suspension or removal from platform

---

### 3.4 No Direct Messaging Between Minors and Instructors

**Principle:** Instructors must not engage in unmonitored, one-to-one communication with learners under 18 outside of structured, logged environments.

**Platform Enforcement:**
- No private messaging features between instructors and learners
- All communication occurs in:
  - Structured Q&A forums (visible to administrators)
  - Live classroom environments (recorded and logged)
  - Feedback on assignments (logged and reviewable)

**Exceptions:**
- Emergency safeguarding situations (e.g., learner discloses harm) must be immediately escalated to platform safeguarding officers
- Instructors may contact parents directly for educational purposes (with logging)

---

### 3.5 Audit Trails

**Principle:** All instructor actions are traceable and reviewable to ensure compliance with platform governance.

**Auditable Actions:**
- Content uploaded or shared with learners
- Feedback provided on assignments
- Attendance records and participation logs
- Module access permissions granted
- Parental communications

**Audit Frequency:**
- Quarterly reviews for all active instructors
- Immediate audits upon safeguarding concerns or complaints
- Random spot-checks for quality assurance
