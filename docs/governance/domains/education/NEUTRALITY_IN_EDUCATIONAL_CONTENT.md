# Neutrality in Educational Content

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how neutrality is maintained in educational content, particularly on sensitive subjects where bias, ideology, or moralising could undermine trust or harm learners.

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to all educational content, curricula, and instructor delivery, with particular focus on:
- Political and civic topics
- Identity and social issues
- Religious and philosophical content
- Sexuality and relationships
- Contemporary geopolitical events

## 3. Neutrality Requirements

### 3.1 Descriptive, Not Prescriptive

**Principle:** Education describes, explains, and contextualises. It does not tell learners what to think, believe, or value.

**Implementation:**
- Present facts, systems, and perspectives without moral judgment
- Acknowledge where disagreement or uncertainty exists
- Avoid language that implies one position is correct or morally superior

**Example:**
- ❌ **Not Neutral:** "Capitalism exploits workers and perpetuates inequality."
- ✅ **Neutral:** "Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership and market competition. Critics argue it can lead to inequality; supporters argue it drives innovation and prosperity."

---

### 3.2 Multiple Perspectives

**Principle:** Where topics are contested, multiple perspectives are presented with balanced weight.

**Implementation:**
- Teach the range of views held by scholars, communities, or cultures
- Avoid privileging one perspective as "enlightened" or "progressive"
- Allow learners to form their own views through critical thinking

**Example:**
- ❌ **Not Neutral:** "Gender is a social construct, and anyone can identify as any gender."
- ✅ **Neutral:** "Gender is understood in different ways across cultures and disciplines. Some view it as biologically determined; others see it as socially constructed. Learners should understand these perspectives and think critically about evidence and values."

---

### 3.3 No Ideological Framing

**Principle:** Educational content does not promote political ideologies such as socialism, libertarianism, conservatism, or progressivism.

**Implementation:**
- Teach about ideologies as systems of thought, not as truths
- Avoid using ideologically loaded terms uncritically (e.g., "oppression," "privilege," "natural rights")
- Present political systems (democracy, authoritarianism, etc.) descriptively, not normatively

**Example:**
- ❌ **Not Neutral:** "Democratic socialism is the fairest system because it balances freedom and equality."
- ✅ **Neutral:** "Democratic socialism combines democratic political systems with social ownership of key industries. Proponents argue it reduces inequality; critics argue it limits economic freedom."

---

### 3.4 Evidence-Based, Not Values-Based

**Principle:** Education prioritises evidence and reasoning over moral assertions or emotional appeals.

**Implementation:**
- Ground teaching in peer-reviewed research, historical records, and verified data
- Distinguish between empirical questions (what is) and normative questions (what should be)
- Avoid presenting contested moral claims as scientific facts

**Example:**
- ❌ **Not Neutral:** "It is wrong to eat meat because animals have rights."
- ✅ **Neutral:** "Some people avoid eating meat for ethical, environmental, or health reasons. Others believe meat consumption is natural and culturally important. Learners can explore these perspectives and the evidence behind them."

---

### 3.5 Contextualise Sensitivity

**Principle:** Sensitive topics are taught with awareness of cultural, familial, and religious diversity.

**Implementation:**
- Acknowledge that learners come from different backgrounds with varying values
- Avoid framing one cultural or moral perspective as universal
- Respect parental authority on contested moral issues

**Example:**
- ❌ **Not Neutral:** "Same-sex marriage is a human right that all societies should recognise."
- ✅ **Neutral:** "Same-sex marriage is legal in some countries and contested in others. Supporters argue it is a matter of equality; opponents often cite religious or cultural beliefs. Laws and attitudes vary globally."

## 4. Sensitive Subjects Requiring Dual Review

The following subject areas require both a **neutrality review** and a **safeguarding review** before delivery:

### 4.1 Recent History (Past 50 Years)

**Risk:** Contemporary events are often politically charged, with competing narratives and unresolved debates.

**Review Focus:**
- Are multiple perspectives represented?
- Is the content free of partisan framing?
- Are sources credible and balanced?

**Examples:**
- The Iraq War, Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, Black Lives Matter, the 2008 financial crisis

---

### 4.2 Identity Topics

**Risk:** Issues of race, gender, sexuality, and identity are culturally contested and emotionally charged.

**Review Focus:**
- Is the content descriptive rather than prescriptive?
- Are diverse viewpoints acknowledged?
- Is the language neutral and non-judgmental?

**Examples:**
- Gender identity, sexual orientation, systemic racism, cultural appropriation, intersectionality

---

### 4.3 Religious Content

**Risk:** Religion is deeply personal and culturally diverse; teaching it poorly can alienate or offend.

**Review Focus:**
- Are all major religions treated with equal respect?
- Is content educational, not evangelical?
- Are secular and non-religious perspectives included?

**Examples:**
- Religious practices, beliefs about the afterlife, religious texts, secularism and atheism

---

### 4.4 Sexuality and Relationships

**Risk:** Moral, cultural, and religious beliefs vary widely on these topics.

**Review Focus:**
- Is content age-appropriate and evidence-based?
- Are diverse family structures and values acknowledged?
- Is consent the primary framing for sexual health education?

**Examples:**
- Sexual health, contraception, LGBTQ+ relationships, consent, abstinence

---

### 4.5 Geopolitics and Conflict

**Risk:** Ongoing conflicts and geopolitical tensions are reported through partisan lenses; historical conflicts are often mythologised.

**Review Focus:**
- Are all sides of a conflict represented fairly?
- Is propaganda or nationalist framing avoided?
- Are sources independent and credible?

**Examples:**
- Israel-Palestine, Russia-Ukraine, Kashmir, Taiwan, colonial history

## 5. Neutrality Audit Process

### Step 1: Content Submission
Instructor or content creator submits module for review.

### Step 2: Neutrality Review
Reviewer assesses:
- Balance of perspectives
- Language and framing
- Ideological or partisan bias
- Cultural sensitivity

### Step 3: Safeguarding Review
Reviewer assesses:
- Age-appropriateness
- Potential for harm or distress
- Consent requirements

### Step 4: Approval or Revision
- **Approved:** Module is released with tier classification
- **Revisions Required:** Specific issues are flagged, and module is returned to creator
- **Rejected:** Module is unsuitable and will not be delivered

## 6. Instructor Training

All instructors receive mandatory training on:
- Recognising bias and ideological framing
- Teaching contested topics neutrally
- Handling sensitive questions from learners
- Escalating concerns about content neutrality

---

## 7. Learner and Parent Feedback

Parents and learners may flag content for neutrality review if they believe it:
- Advocates for a political ideology
- Presents contested issues as settled truth
- Moralises on sensitive topics
- Excludes important perspectives

Flagged content is reviewed within **7 days**, with a response provided to the reporter.

---

## 8. Review and Updates

This framework is reviewed:
- Annually
- Upon significant societal or geopolitical changes
- Following feedback from parents, learners, or instructors

---

**Neutrality is not avoidance. It is intellectual honesty.**
