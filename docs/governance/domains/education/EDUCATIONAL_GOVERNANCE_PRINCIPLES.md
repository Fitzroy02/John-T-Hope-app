# Educational Governance Principles

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes the core principles governing educational content and delivery within the platform.  
It ensures that education operates with integrity, safety, transparency, and respect for developmental stages.

## 2. Scope

These principles apply to all educational content, curricula, learning modules, and instructor interactions within the platform, across all age tiers.

## 3. Core Principles

### 3.1 Age-Appropriate Delivery
- All educational content must be matched to the cognitive, emotional, and developmental stage of learners
- Content complexity, language, and themes must align with established age tiers
- No exposure to material beyond the learner's developmental readiness

### 3.2 Non-Partisan Stance
- Educational content must not promote political parties, candidates, or partisan ideologies
- Civic education focuses on systems, processes, and critical thinking, not persuasion
- Multiple perspectives are presented where applicable, with balanced framing

### 3.3 Non-Ideological Approach
- Education avoids imposing contested moral, religious, or philosophical beliefs as universal truth
- Sensitive topics are presented with contextual framing and acknowledgment of diverse perspectives
- Learners are equipped to think critically, not told what to think

### 3.4 Evidence-Informed Content
- Educational materials are based on peer-reviewed research, established scholarship, and verified facts
- Where consensus does not exist, this is acknowledged explicitly
- Speculative or emerging theories are clearly identified as such

### 3.5 Culturally Contextualised
- Educational content respects cultural, linguistic, and regional diversity
- Global content is adapted to local contexts where appropriate
- No cultural imperialism or erasure of minority perspectives

### 3.6 Safeguarding-Aligned
- All content and interactions are designed with child protection and learner safety as the foundation
- Safeguarding protocols are embedded in every aspect of educational delivery
- Instructor boundaries and visibility requirements are strictly enforced

### 3.7 Transparent Authorship
- All educational materials include clear attribution of authors, reviewers, and sources
- Conflicts of interest or funding sources are disclosed where relevant
- Learners and parents can trace the origin and review process of any content

## 4. Prohibited Practices

### 4.1 No Political Ideologies
- Content must not advocate for socialism, libertarianism, conservatism, progressivism, or any other political ideology
- Elections, candidates, and party politics are not presented as educational material unless in appropriate civic literacy contexts with strict neutrality

### 4.2 No Moralising on Contested Issues
- Topics such as abortion, gender identity, sexuality, religion, and immigration are not taught with moral judgments
- When these topics are addressed, they are presented descriptively and contextually, not prescriptively

### 4.3 No Adult Themes Without Consent
- Sexual content, graphic violence, substance use, and other adult themes require explicit parental consent
- Consent is obtained prior to exposure, not retroactively
- Tier-appropriate boundaries are never bypassed

### 4.4 No Persuasive Design
- Educational platforms must not use gamification, social pressure, or engagement metrics to manipulate learners
- Learning should be driven by curiosity and understanding, not addictive design patterns

### 4.5 No Contemporary Controversies as Fact
- Current political debates, ongoing conflicts, and contested scientific theories are not presented as settled truth
- Historical context and multiple interpretations are provided where applicable

### 4.6 No Override of Parental Authority
- Parents retain the right to withdraw consent, request alternative materials, or opt out of sensitive content
- Platform does not substitute its judgment for parental values on contested moral or cultural issues

## 5. Implementation

These principles are operationalised through:
- Age-tiered curriculum design
- Dual review processes for sensitive content
- Safeguarding protocols and interaction logging
- Parental consent mechanisms
- Neutrality audits and content review

## 6. Review and Accountability

- This framework is reviewed annually and upon major content updates
- Breaches of these principles may result in content removal, instructor suspension, or platform restriction
- Parents, learners, and educators may flag content for review at any time

**These principles are non-negotiable. Education must protect, not indoctrinate.**
