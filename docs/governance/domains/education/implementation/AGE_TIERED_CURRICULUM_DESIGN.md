# Age-Tiered Curriculum Design

## 1. Purpose

This guide provides practical instructions for designing curriculum content that respects age-tier boundaries and developmental appropriateness.

## 2. Scope

This guide applies to curriculum designers, content creators, and instructors developing learning modules for the platform.

## 3. Tier-Specific Design Principles

### Tier 1 (Ages 5–8): Foundation Building

**Cognitive Characteristics:**
- Concrete thinking; limited abstract reasoning
- Short attention spans (10–15 minutes)
- Learning through play, repetition, and sensory experience

**Design Guidelines:**
- Use simple, clear language with short sentences
- Incorporate visual aids, stories, and interactive activities
- Focus on observable, concrete concepts (colours, shapes, counting, letters)
- Avoid abstract or contested ideas (justice, fairness as moral concepts)

**Content Restrictions:**
- No political or social issues
- No identity or gender topics
- No death, violence, or trauma
- No sexual education
- No religious instruction beyond basic cultural awareness

**Example Topics:**
- ✅ Counting objects, basic addition
- ✅ Letter sounds and simple words
- ✅ Personal safety (saying no, trusted adults)
- ✅ Cooperation games and sharing
- ❌ Discussing "fairness" in societal systems
- ❌ Explaining family diversity or gender identity

---

### Tier 2 (Ages 9–12): Foundational Knowledge

**Cognitive Characteristics:**
- Developing abstract thinking
- Longer attention spans (20–30 minutes)
- Beginning to understand cause and effect

**Design Guidelines:**
- Introduce foundational subject knowledge with clear structure
- Use age-appropriate analogies and examples
- Encourage basic critical thinking (compare, contrast, explain)
- Begin digital citizenship education

**Content Restrictions:**
- No political ideologies or party politics
- Sensitive topics (puberty, body literacy) require parental consent
- No adult themes (sex, violence, substance use)
- Contemporary controversies avoided

**Example Topics:**
- ✅ How the water cycle works
- ✅ Basic historical timelines (descriptive, not moral)
- ✅ Digital safety (passwords, online strangers)
- ✅ Puberty education (with consent)
- ❌ Climate change as a moral or political issue
- ❌ Discussing current elections or political campaigns

---

### Tier 3 (Ages 13–15): Critical Exploration

**Cognitive Characteristics:**
- Abstract reasoning established
- Questioning authority and norms
- Developing personal identity and values

**Design Guidelines:**
- Encourage deeper critical thinking and analysis
- Introduce multiple perspectives on contested topics
- Use real-world examples with contextual framing
- Teach media literacy and source evaluation

**Content Restrictions:**
- Political systems taught neutrally
- Sensitive topics (identity, religion, sexuality) require contextual framing
- No graphic violence or explicit sexual content
- Controversial subjects require dual review

**Example Topics:**
- ✅ How democratic and authoritarian systems function
- ✅ Media literacy: recognising bias in news
- ✅ Body autonomy and consent
- ✅ Historical injustices (slavery, colonialism) with multiple perspectives
- ❌ Advocating for socialism, capitalism, or any ideology
- ❌ Presenting gender identity as settled science without acknowledging debate

---

### Tier 4 (Ages 16–18): Advanced Autonomy

**Cognitive Characteristics:**
- Fully developed abstract reasoning
- Capable of nuanced moral and ethical thinking
- Preparing for adult independence

**Design Guidelines:**
- Challenge learners with complex, ambiguous topics
- Teach ideologies critically, not prescriptively
- Allow for independent research and debate
- Respect learner autonomy while maintaining safeguarding

**Content Restrictions:**
- Graphic or traumatic content requires advance warning
- Strict neutrality maintained on contested issues
- Ideological framing explicitly labelled

**Example Topics:**
- ✅ Comparative political ideologies (socialism, libertarianism, etc.)
- ✅ Ethical dilemmas in medicine, technology, and law
- ✅ Sexual health and relationships (with opt-out)
- ✅ Geopolitical conflicts with multiple perspectives
- ❌ Advocating for any political party or candidate
- ❌ Framing one moral position as objectively correct

## 4. Content Development Checklist

### Before Creating Content

- [ ] Identify the target age tier
- [ ] Review tier-specific restrictions and requirements
- [ ] Determine sensitivity level (low, moderate, high)
- [ ] Identify if parental consent is required

### During Content Creation

- [ ] Use age-appropriate language and complexity
- [ ] Ensure neutrality on contested topics
- [ ] Include multiple perspectives where applicable
- [ ] Cite credible, evidence-based sources
- [ ] Avoid ideological or partisan framing

### After Content Creation

- [ ] Submit for neutrality review (if sensitive)
- [ ] Submit for safeguarding review (if sensitive)
- [ ] Test with sample learners for appropriateness
- [ ] Document authorship, sources, and version

## 5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Over-Complexity
Avoid introducing abstract concepts too early (e.g., teaching systemic oppression to Tier 1 learners).

### Under-Estimation
Avoid treating Tier 4 learners as children; they can handle complex, contested topics with proper framing.

### Ideology Creep
Avoid letting personal beliefs influence framing (e.g., presenting climate change as purely a moral issue rather than a scientific and political topic).

### Cultural Insensitivity
Avoid assuming all learners share Western, secular, or progressive values.

## 6. Cross-Tier Content Adaptation

If a topic is valuable across multiple tiers, adapt it carefully:

**Example: Democracy**

| **Tier** | **Approach** |
|----------|--------------|
| Tier 1 (5–8) | ❌ Too abstract; defer to later tiers |
| Tier 2 (9–12) | ✅ "Democracy means people vote to choose leaders." |
| Tier 3 (13–15) | ✅ "In democracies, citizens vote for representatives. Different countries practice democracy differently." |
| Tier 4 (16–18) | ✅ "Democracy is a political system with many variations. We'll compare parliamentary, presidential, and direct democracy, and examine critiques from different ideological perspectives." |

---

## 7. Review and Iteration

Curriculum content should be reviewed:
- Annually for accuracy and relevance
- After learner feedback or complaints
- When new evidence or scholarship emerges

---

**Age-appropriate design is not dumbing down. It is respecting development.**
