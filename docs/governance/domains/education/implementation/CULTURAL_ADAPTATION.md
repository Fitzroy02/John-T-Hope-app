# Cultural Adaptation

## 1. Purpose

This guide explains how to adapt educational content for diverse cultural, linguistic, and regional contexts while maintaining neutrality and respecting local values.

## 2. Scope

This guide applies to curriculum designers, content creators, and platform administrators delivering education across multiple cultural contexts.

---

## 3. Cultural Adaptation Principles

### 3.1 Respect for Diversity
Educational content acknowledges that learners come from diverse cultural, religious, and linguistic backgrounds.

### 3.2 No Cultural Imperialism
The platform does not impose Western, secular, or progressive values as universal.

### 3.3 Local Contextualisation
Where appropriate, global content is adapted to local contexts to ensure relevance and respect.

### 3.4 Transparency
Adaptations are documented and explained, so parents and learners understand why content differs across regions.

---

## 4. Cultural Adaptation Framework

### 4.1 Three Levels of Adaptation

**Level 1: Universal Content**
- Core knowledge that is culturally neutral (e.g., mathematics, basic science)
- Delivered identically across all contexts
- No adaptation required

**Level 2: Contextualised Content**
- Topics that require cultural framing (e.g., history, civics, literature)
- Examples, case studies, and language adapted to local context
- Core principles remain consistent

**Level 3: Locally Determined Content**
- Topics where cultural or religious values diverge significantly (e.g., sexual education, religious instruction)
- Content differs based on local laws, norms, and parental preferences
- Platform provides multiple versions or allows opt-out

---

## 5. Contextualised Content: Implementation

### 5.1 Historical Content

**Challenge:** History is interpreted differently across cultures.

**Approach:**
- Teach multiple perspectives on contested historical events
- Acknowledge where national narratives differ
- Avoid framing one nation's history as inherently superior or inferior

**Example: Colonialism**

**Global Core:**
> "Colonialism refers to the practice of one nation controlling another, often for economic or strategic gain. Colonial powers included Britain, France, Spain, and others. Colonialism had profound impacts on colonised peoples, including economic exploitation, cultural disruption, and political control."

**UK Adaptation:**
> "Britain was one of the largest colonial powers. Some argue the British Empire brought infrastructure and governance to colonised regions; others argue it caused exploitation, violence, and cultural destruction. These perspectives remain contested in Britain today."

**Indian Adaptation:**
> "India was under British colonial rule for nearly 200 years. This period involved economic extraction, political control, and cultural suppression. Independence in 1947 marked the end of colonial rule and the beginning of a new national identity."

### 5.2 Civic Education

**Challenge:** Political systems and civic norms vary globally.

**Approach:**
- Teach the political system relevant to the learner's context
- Compare with other systems neutrally
- Avoid advocating for democracy, authoritarianism, or any specific system as inherently superior

**Example: Governance Systems**

**UK Adaptation:**
> "The UK is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy. Citizens vote for Members of Parliament, who form the government. The monarch is the head of state but has limited political power."

**US Adaptation:**
> "The US is a federal republic with a presidential system. Citizens vote for the President and members of Congress. Power is divided between federal and state governments."

**UAE Adaptation:**
> "The UAE is a federation of seven emirates, each led by a ruler. The federal government handles national matters, while emirate governments manage local issues. Civic participation occurs through advisory councils."

---

### 5.3 Religious and Moral Education

**Challenge:** Religious and moral values differ widely across cultures.

**Approach:**
- Religious instruction is optional and parent-led
- Platform provides resources but does not impose beliefs
- Sensitive moral topics (abortion, euthanasia) are presented descriptively, not prescriptively

**Example: Religion in Education**

**Secular Context (e.g., France):**
> "The platform provides educational resources on world religions as cultural and historical topics. Religious instruction is not part of the core curriculum."

**Religious Context (e.g., Saudi Arabia):**
> "The platform supports Islamic education as part of the core curriculum, with resources aligned to local values. Parents may request additional materials or exemptions."

**Diverse Context (e.g., UK):**
> "The platform offers opt-in religious education modules for major world religions (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, etc.). Parents choose which, if any, their child accesses."

---

## 6. Locally Determined Content: Implementation

### 6.1 Sexual Education

**Challenge:** Cultural and religious views on sexual education vary widely.

**Approach:**
- Platform provides multiple versions of sexual health modules
- Parents choose the version aligned with their values
- Versions range from abstinence-focused to comprehensive

**Example Versions:**

**Version A (Comprehensive):**
> "This module covers consent, contraception, STI prevention, sexual orientation, and healthy relationships. It is evidence-based and non-judgmental."

**Version B (Moderate):**
> "This module covers puberty, body autonomy, and healthy relationships. Sexual activity is discussed in the context of committed relationships."

**Version C (Abstinence-Focused):**
> "This module covers puberty and body literacy. Sexual activity is taught as appropriate within marriage. Abstinence is presented as the recommended choice for young people."

---

### 6.2 Gender and Identity

**Challenge:** Views on gender identity and roles differ culturally.

**Approach:**
- Core curriculum teaches biological sex as a fact
- Gender as a social construct is presented as one perspective among many
- Parents may opt into or out of identity-focused modules

**Example:**

**Global Core (Tier 3):**
> "In many societies, gender roles have evolved over time. Some cultures distinguish between biological sex and gender identity. Learners should understand these perspectives and think critically about evidence and values."

**Opt-In Module:**
> "This module explores gender identity, including non-binary and transgender identities. It covers terminology, lived experiences, and ongoing debates in science and society."

## 7. Language Adaptation

### 7.1 Translation and Localisation

**Translation:**
- All core content is translated into the learner's primary language
- Translations reviewed by native speakers for accuracy and cultural appropriateness

**Localisation:**
- Examples, names, and scenarios adapted to local context
- Currency, units, and cultural references localised

**Example:**
- **Global:** "Sarah went to the shop and bought bread for £2."
- **US Localisation:** "Sarah went to the store and bought bread for $2."
- **UAE Localisation:** "Fatima went to the shop and bought bread for AED 7."

## 8. Cultural Sensitivity Review

### 8.1 When Cultural Sensitivity Review is Required

**Triggers:**
- Content being delivered in a new cultural context for the first time
- Parent or community feedback about cultural insensitivity
- Content covering religious, moral, or identity topics

### 8.2 Reviewer Qualifications

**Cultural Sensitivity Reviewers Must:**
- Be members of the cultural or religious community in question
- Have educational or community leadership experience
- Be trained in recognising stereotyping, erasure, or misrepresentation

---

## 9. Community Consultation

### 9.1 Advisory Panels

Platform establishes regional or cultural advisory panels to:
- Review proposed adaptations
- Provide feedback on culturally sensitive topics
- Flag potential issues before content is delivered

**Panel Composition:**
- Parents from the community
- Educators with local expertise
- Religious or cultural leaders (where applicable)

---

## 10. Opt-Out and Alternative Provision

### 10.1 When Parents Opt Out

Parents who find adapted content inconsistent with their values may:
- Opt their child out of specific modules
- Request alternative materials
- Provide home-based education on the topic

**Platform Support:**
- Provide take-home resources aligned with parental values
- Ensure opting out does not disadvantage the learner
- Offer one-to-one consultation for concerned parents

---

## 11. Cultural Adaptation Metrics

Track and report:
- Number of adaptations per region/culture
- Opt-out rates for culturally sensitive modules
- Parent feedback on cultural appropriateness
- Requests for additional adaptations

---

## 12. Review and Continuous Improvement

Cultural adaptation is reviewed:
- Annually for each region or cultural context
- Following community feedback or complaints
- When significant cultural or political shifts occur

---

**Cultural adaptation is not relativism. It is respect for human diversity.**
