# Healthcare Content Categories

**Four-Level Framework for Healthcare Content**

---

## Purpose

This document establishes a clear taxonomy for healthcare content, enabling appropriate content categorization, risk assessment, and governance application.

---

## The Four Levels

Healthcare content is organized into four distinct levels, each with specific characteristics, governance requirements, and access controls.

---

## Level 1: General Health Awareness

### Definition
Broad, non-sensitive health information suitable for all ages with minimal adaptation.

### Characteristics
- Universal health concepts
- General wellness principles
- Basic health literacy
- No sensitive topics
- Minimal age calibration needed

### Examples
- What is exercise and why is it important?
- Understanding hydration
- Basic nutrition concepts
- Sleep and rest
- Hand washing and hygiene
- General immune system awareness

### Governance Requirements
- Standard content review
- Evidence-informed sources
- Age-appropriate language (but concepts universal)
- Cultural sensitivity review
- No diagnosis/prescription (standard prohibition)

### Access Controls
- Available to all age tiers
- No parental consent required
- Minimal risk assessment

### Risk Level
**Low** - Content is general, uncontroversial, and widely accepted.

---

## Level 2: Body Literacy & Development

### Definition
Age-appropriate content about human anatomy, development, and physiological processes.

### Characteristics
- Body systems and functions
- Growth and development
- Puberty and reproductive health
- Mental health literacy
- Age-specific calibration required

### Examples
- Understanding puberty (age-tiered content)
- Reproductive system education (age-appropriate)
- Menstruation literacy
- Mental health awareness
- Body changes during adolescence
- Understanding emotions and mood

### Governance Requirements
- Mandatory age-tiering
- Safeguarding review
- Cultural adaptation considerations
- Parental notification (jurisdiction-dependent)
- Clear, accurate anatomical language
- Developmentally appropriate detail levels

### Access Controls
- Age-gated content
- Age verification required for sensitive topics
- Parental controls available
- Country-specific legal compliance

### Risk Level
**Moderate** - Content is sensitive but essential. Requires careful governance but is developmentally necessary.

---

## Level 3: Condition Literacy

### Definition
Educational content about specific health conditions, symptoms, and medical processes.

### Characteristics
- Specific health conditions explained
- Symptom awareness (NOT diagnosis)
- Treatment options overview (NOT prescription)
- Chronic condition literacy
- Acute condition awareness

### Examples
- Understanding diabetes (what it is, not diagnosis)
- Asthma awareness (triggers, not treatment advice)
- Mental health conditions (depression, anxiety explained)
- Understanding allergies
- Cancer awareness (what it is, not medical advice)
- Chronic pain conditions explained

### Governance Requirements
- **Strict non-diagnostic language**
- **Strict non-prescriptive language**
- Medical review mandatory
- Evidence-based content only
- Clear sourcing and citations
- Acknowledgment of when to seek professional help
- Age-appropriate complexity
- Safeguarding integration (for MH conditions)
- Cultural sensitivity (stigma awareness)

### Access Controls
- Age verification required
- Parental notification or consent (age-dependent)
- Risk assessment for specific conditions
- Integration with safeguarding protocols (especially mental health)
- Country-specific legal compliance

### Risk Level
**Moderate-to-High** - Content is medically sensitive. Users may be seeking personal answers. Strict governance prevents misuse as self-diagnosis.

---

## Level 4: High-Risk/Sensitive Topics

### Definition
Healthcare content that carries significant safeguarding, legal, or medical risk.

### Characteristics
- High safeguarding risk
- Potential for harm if misunderstood
- Legally restricted in some jurisdictions
- Requires extensive governance oversight
- May trigger safeguarding protocols

### Examples
- Self-harm awareness and prevention
- Suicide prevention content
- Eating disorder awareness
- Substance abuse education
- Sexual health (jurisdiction-dependent)
- Abortion information (jurisdiction-dependent)
- Gender identity and medical transition (jurisdiction-dependent)
- Terminal illness and end-of-life care

### Governance Requirements
- **Maximum governance oversight**
- Mandatory medical and safeguarding review
- Legal review for jurisdictional compliance
- Age restrictions rigorously enforced
- Parental consent where legally required
- Clear escalation pathways for users in crisis
- Integration with crisis resources
- Cultural and legal adaptation mandatory
- Transparent authorship and medical credentials
- Regular content review and updates

### Access Controls
- **Strict age verification**
- Parental consent required (age-dependent, jurisdiction-dependent)
- Geolocation-based content adaptation
- Country-specific legal compliance
- Integration with safeguarding systems
- Mandatory risk assessments before access
- Crisis support integration

### Risk Level
**High** - Content is medically, legally, and emotionally sensitive. Governance is paramount.

## Content Category Assignment Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
Content creators propose category assignment based on topic.

### Step 2: Governance Review
Governance lead reviews and confirms or adjusts category.

### Step 3: Risk Assessment
Safeguarding and legal implications assessed.

### Step 4: Requirements Applied
Governance requirements for assigned category applied.

### Step 5: Content Development
Content developed with category-specific requirements in mind.

### Step 6: Review and Approval
Content reviewed against category requirements before publication.

---

## Cross-Category Principles

All healthcare content, regardless of category, must be:
- **Non-diagnostic**
- **Non-prescriptive**
- **Evidence-informed**
- **Age-appropriate**
- **Culturally sensitive**
- **Transparently authored**
- **Safeguarding-aligned**
- **Regularly reviewed**

---

## Category Migration

Content may move categories if:
- Medical consensus changes
- Legal frameworks evolve
- Safeguarding risk is reassessed
- Cultural sensitivity concerns emerge
- Age-appropriateness is reconsidered

Category migration requires governance approval.

---

## Content That Doesn't Fit

Some healthcare-adjacent topics may not fit neatly into these categories. In such cases:
1. Assess most appropriate category by risk level
2. Apply strictest governance requirements if uncertain
3. Seek governance lead guidance
4. Document decision rationale

---

## Usage in Practice

### Content Creators
Reference this framework when proposing healthcare content.

### Governance Team
Use this framework to categorize and apply appropriate oversight.

### Technical Team
Implement access controls and age-gating based on categories.

### Safeguarding Team
Risk assess based on category levels.

---

## Review Cycle

This framework is reviewed:
- Annually
- Upon introduction of new healthcare content types
- When legal or medical standards evolve
- At the request of governance lead
