# Healthcare Governance Principles

**Domain-Specific Implementation of Constitutional Spine**

---

## Purpose

This document establishes the foundational governance principles for healthcare-related content within the Hopenism ecosystem. These principles demonstrate how the constitutional spine operates in practice within a sensitive, regulated domain.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Non-Diagnostic

**Principle**: Content must never diagnose medical conditions.

**Application**:
- No content may suggest a user has a specific medical condition
- No symptom checkers or diagnostic tools
- No "if you have these symptoms, you might have X" frameworks
- Focus on general awareness and literacy, not diagnosis

**Rationale**: Diagnosis is a regulated medical activity requiring professional qualifications, patient examination, and clinical judgment.

---

### 2. Non-Prescriptive

**Principle**: Content must never prescribe treatments or medical interventions.

**Application**:
- No "you should take X medication" statements
- No treatment recommendations
- No supplement or therapy prescriptions
- No dosage guidance
- Focus on explaining what exists, not what someone should do

**Rationale**: Prescribing is a regulated medical activity. Individual circumstances vary significantly.

---

### 3. Evidence-Informed

**Principle**: All healthcare content must be grounded in established medical evidence.

**Application**:
- Content based on peer-reviewed research
- Recognition of scientific consensus
- Clear sourcing and attribution
- Acknowledgment of uncertainty where it exists
- No promotion of unproven treatments

**Rationale**: Healthcare misinformation causes real harm. Evidence-based content protects users.

---

### 4. Age-Tiered

**Principle**: Healthcare content must be developmentally appropriate.

**Application**:
- Content calibrated to cognitive and emotional development
- Age-appropriate language and concepts
- Progressive disclosure aligned with maturity
- Safeguarding considerations at every tier
- Parental involvement where legally and developmentally required

**Rationale**: Healthcare information needs vary dramatically across age groups. What's appropriate for a 17-year-old is not appropriate for an 8-year-old.

---

### 5. Culturally Contextualized

**Principle**: Healthcare content must acknowledge cultural variation in healthcare practices, beliefs, and legal frameworks.

**Application**:
- Recognition of diverse cultural health practices
- Respect for cultural beliefs about health and body
- Legal variation across jurisdictions
- No single cultural framework assumed as universal
- Inclusive language that acknowledges diversity

**Rationale**: Healthcare exists within cultural contexts. Effective, respectful content acknowledges this reality.

---

### 6. Clinically Neutral

**Principle**: Content must maintain neutrality on contested or emerging medical topics.

**Application**:
- No advocacy for specific treatment approaches where medical community is divided
- Balanced presentation of established medical viewpoints
- Acknowledgment of ongoing debates
- 10-year buffer for newly emerging medical practices
- Focus on literacy, not persuasion

**Rationale**: Medical consensus evolves. Premature advocacy can cause harm.

---

### 7. Safeguarding-Aligned

**Principle**: All healthcare content must align with child safeguarding principles.

**Application**:
- Age verification for sensitive topics
- Safeguarding risk assessments for all content
- Clear escalation pathways for concerning disclosures
- Integration with safeguarding frameworks
- Mandatory reporting compliance

**Rationale**: Healthcare education exists within safeguarding context. Vulnerable users require protection.

---

### 8. Transparent Authorship

**Principle**: Healthcare content must have clear, qualified authorship.

**Application**:
- Author credentials visible
- Medical review process documented
- Content review dates stated
- Update history maintained
- Sources cited

**Rationale**: Trust requires transparency. Users need to assess content credibility.
