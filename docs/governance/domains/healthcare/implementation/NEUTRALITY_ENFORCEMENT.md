## Content Creation Guidelines

### Language Audit Framework

Every healthcare content piece undergoes language audit for neutrality.

**Audit Questions**:
1. Does this content advocate for a specific treatment approach?
2. Does this content present one perspective as definitively correct where debate exists?
3. Does this content use persuasive rather than educational language?
4. Does this content acknowledge uncertainty where it exists?
5. Does this content respect cultural and medical variation?
6. Does this content apply the 10-year buffer to emerging practices?

If any answer raises concerns, content is revised.

### Neutral Language Patterns

#### Presenting Treatment Options

✅ **Neutral**:
"Treatment for [condition] may include [X], [Y], or [Z]. Each approach has different benefits and considerations. Your healthcare provider can help determine what's appropriate for your specific situation."

❌ **Non-Neutral**:
"The best treatment for [condition] is [X]. Other approaches are less effective."

---

#### Discussing Contested Topics

✅ **Neutral**:
"Medical professionals have different perspectives on [topic]. Some recommend [approach A] based on [rationale], while others prefer [approach B] based on [rationale]. Research continues in this area."

❌ **Non-Neutral**:
"[Approach A] is outdated. Modern medicine clearly shows [approach B] is superior."

---

#### Acknowledging Uncertainty

✅ **Neutral**:
"Research on [topic] is ongoing. Current understanding suggests [X], but scientists are still learning about [Y]. This means recommendations may evolve as more evidence becomes available."

❌ **Non-Neutral**:
"While some claim [X], the truth is [Y]."

---

#### Cultural Variation

✅ **Neutral**:
"Healthcare practices and beliefs about [topic] vary across cultures. In some contexts, [approach A] is common, while in others, [approach B] is preferred. Both perspectives exist for valid cultural and medical reasons."

❌ **Non-Neutral**:
"The correct way to approach [topic] is [X]. Cultural beliefs that differ are simply myths."

---

### Forbidden Language Patterns

❌ **Absolute Claims**: "Always," "never," "everyone should"  
❌ **Value Judgments**: "Best," "worst," "obviously," "clearly superior"  
❌ **Dismissive Language**: "Outdated," "myths," "wrong"  
❌ **Persuasive Language**: "You should," "you must," "you need to"  
❌ **False Certainty**: Presenting evolving science as settled  
❌ **Cultural Superiority**: Dismissing non-Western or traditional perspectives  

---

### Required Language Patterns

✅ **Conditional Language**: "May," "might," "some," "often," "can"  
✅ **Attribution**: "Research suggests," "medical professionals recommend," "studies show"  
✅ **Acknowledgment of Variation**: "Different approaches exist," "may vary based on"  
✅ **Encouragement of Professional Consultation**: "Talk to your healthcare provider"  
✅ **Acknowledgment of Uncertainty**: "Research is ongoing," "evidence continues to evolve"

## Content Review Process

### Three-Layer Review

#### Layer 1: Creator Self-Review
Content creator uses neutrality checklist before submission.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Language is educational, not persuasive
- [ ] Multiple perspectives presented where debate exists
- [ ] Uncertainty acknowledged where it exists
- [ ] Cultural variation respected
- [ ] 10-year buffer applied to emerging practices
- [ ] Medical consensus represented accurately
- [ ] No forbidden language patterns used

---

#### Layer 2: Editorial Review
Editor reviews content for neutrality compliance.

**Review Focus**:
- Language neutrality
- Balance of perspectives
- Accuracy of medical consensus representation
- Cultural sensitivity
- 10-year buffer compliance

**Outcome**:
- Approve → Content proceeds
- Revise → Content returned with specific feedback
- Escalate → Content raises complex neutrality questions, sent to governance review

---

#### Layer 3: Governance Review (When Required)
Governance lead reviews content that:
- Addresses highly contested topics
- Applies 10-year buffer
- Received conflicting feedback from reviewers
- Raises novel neutrality questions

**Outcome**:
- Approve with guidance
- Require revision
- Reject (content violates neutrality principles)
- Request external expert review

---

### External Expert Review

For highly contested or technically complex topics, external medical experts review content for:
- Accuracy of medical information
- Fair representation of medical debate
- Appropriate neutrality
- Cultural competence

**When Triggered**:
- Novel or controversial topics
- Emerging medical practices
- Content where internal expertise is insufficient
- High-stakes topics (suicide prevention, eating disorders, reproductive health)

---

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Violation Severity Levels

#### Level 1: Minor Neutrality Drift
**Example**: Slightly persuasive language, easily corrected

**Response**:
- Editor catches and corrects during review
- Content revised and republished
- Creator feedback provided
- No formal action

---

#### Level 2: Moderate Neutrality Violation
**Example**: Advocating for specific treatment, presenting contested topic as settled

**Response**:
- Content removed from production immediately
- Governance review required
- Creator receives formal feedback and retraining
- Content substantially revised before republication
- Pattern monitored

---

#### Level 3: Serious Neutrality Violation
**Example**: Promoting unproven treatments, cultural insensitivity, dangerous medical advice

**Response**:
- Content removed immediately
- Governance lead conducts full review
- Creator removed from healthcare content creation pending review
- All creator's healthcare content audited
- Determination of intentional vs. negligent violation
- Disciplinary action up to and including removal from healthcare content team

---

### Proactive Enforcement

#### Regular Content Audits
- Quarterly audits of published healthcare content
- Check for neutrality drift
- Assess whether medical consensus has evolved
- Update content as needed

#### User Feedback Integration
- Users can flag content as non-neutral
- Flags reviewed by governance team
- Flagged content audited
- Revisions made if warranted

#### Medical Advisory Review
- Annual review by medical advisory board (if established)
- Assessment of neutrality compliance
- Guidance on emerging medical debates
- Recommendations for content updates

## Neutrality in Practice: Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Depression Treatment Content

**Non-Neutral Approach**:
"Depression should be treated with medication. Therapy alone is insufficient for most people."

**Neutral Approach**:
"Depression treatment often includes therapy, medication, or both. Research shows different approaches work for different people. Some people benefit most from medication, some from therapy, and many from a combination. Your healthcare provider can help determine what's right for you."

---

### Scenario 2: Vaccination Content

**Non-Neutral Approach**:
"Vaccines are completely safe and everyone must get vaccinated."

**Neutral Approach**:
"Vaccines undergo extensive safety testing. Like all medical interventions, they carry some risk of side effects, though serious effects are rare. Major medical organizations worldwide recommend vaccination as an important public health measure. Consult with your healthcare provider about vaccination decisions."

---

### Scenario 3: Emerging Treatment (Less Than 10 Years)

**Non-Neutral Approach**:
"This exciting new treatment is revolutionizing care for [condition]."

**Neutral Approach**:
"[Treatment] is a newer approach to managing [condition], approved in [year]. Early research shows promise, but long-term data is still being gathered. Some healthcare providers are adopting this approach while others prefer established treatments until more evidence is available. Discuss with your healthcare provider whether this is appropriate for your situation."

---

### Scenario 4: Culturally Variable Practice

**Non-Neutral Approach**:
"Western medicine is evidence-based. Traditional medicine is just cultural belief."

**Neutral Approach**:
"Healthcare practices vary across cultures. Evidence-based medicine, developed primarily in Western contexts, emphasizes treatments validated through clinical trials. Many cultures also practice traditional medicine with long histories. Some individuals integrate both approaches. Healthcare decisions are personal and should be made in consultation with qualified healthcare providers."
