# Age-Tiered Healthcare Learning

**Implementation Guide for Age-Appropriate Healthcare Content**

---

## Purpose

This guide provides practical implementation details for delivering age-appropriate healthcare content aligned with developmental stages, cognitive capacity, and legal frameworks.

---

## Age Tier Structure

Healthcare content is delivered across six age tiers, each with distinct characteristics, permissions, and content approaches.

---

## Tier 1: Ages 5-7 (Early Childhood)

### Developmental Characteristics
- Concrete thinking
- Limited abstract reasoning
- Beginning to understand body basics
- High curiosity, simple questions

- "Doctors and nurses help people feel better"
- "Exercise makes your body strong"

### Prohibited Content
- Detailed anatomy

## Content Tier Assignment Process

### Step 1: Determine Content Category
Use Healthcare Content Categories framework to categorize content.

### Step 2: Assess Developmental Appropriateness
Determine minimum age tier for content based on:
- Cognitive complexity
- Emotional maturity required
- Legal restrictions
- Safeguarding risk

### Step 3: Define Tier-Specific Versions
Create age-appropriate versions:
- Language complexity
- Detail level
- Context and framing
- Examples used

### Step 4: Set Access Controls
Implement technical controls:
- Age verification
- Parental consent (where required)
- Geolocation-based rules

### Step 5: Review and Approve
Content reviewed for developmental appropriateness at each tier.

---

## Progressive Disclosure

Healthcare concepts are introduced progressively across tiers.

### Example: Mental Health

**Tier 1 (5-7)**: "Everyone has feelings. Sometimes we feel happy, sometimes sad."

**Tier 2 (8-10)**: "Everyone has emotions. Feeling worried sometimes is normal. Talking to adults you trust helps."

**Tier 3 (11-13)**: "Anxiety is a feeling of worry or nervousness. Everyone experiences it sometimes. If it's happening a lot and affecting your life, talking to a trusted adult or counselor can help."

**Tier 4 (14-15)**: "Anxiety disorders are medical conditions where anxiety is persistent and interferes with daily life. Different types exist (generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder). Treatment options include therapy and medication. Professional help is important."

**Tier 5 (16-17)**: "Understanding anxiety disorders: symptoms, types, treatment approaches (CBT, medication, combination), when to seek help, how to find appropriate care, managing alongside school/work."

**Tier 6 (18+)**: Comprehensive anxiety disorder literacy, treatment options, evidence base, healthcare navigation, understanding research.
