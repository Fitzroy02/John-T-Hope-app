## Slide 1: Opening

### Title  
**Our honesty is integrity you can trust.**

### Subtitle  
**The secure choice for creative and cultural transactions.**

### Narrative Block  
Creative and cultural work deserves a safer, more professional environment than unregulated marketplaces can offer.  

We built a platform where agreements are clear, transactions are protected, and culture is treated with the respect it deserves.

### Three Pillars  
- **Protected transactions** from the moment a contract is signed  
- **Verified, professional users** across the cultural ecosystem  
- **A trust-first infrastructure** designed for DJs, venues, promoters, and cultural workers

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### The Current State  
Cultural workers—DJs, promoters, venues, and creative professionals—operate in an unprotected, chaotic environment.

### Pain Points  
- **No transaction protection**: Agreements can fall apart with no recourse
- **No verification**: High fraud and trust issues
- **No legal support**: Disputes are expensive and isolating
- **Generic platforms**: Built for volume, not culture
- **Unprofessional infrastructure**: Chaos over clarity

### The Cost  
Lost bookings, unpaid work, legal fees, damaged reputations, and a culture of mistrust.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### Our Platform  
A protected, professional ecosystem specifically designed for cultural transactions.

### What We Provide

2. **Smart contracts** that are clear and enforceable  
3. **Verified profiles** for trust and accountability  
4. **Region-first, culture-aware matching** algorithms  
5. **Dispute resolution support** with solicitor-fee coverage

## Slide 4: How It Works
