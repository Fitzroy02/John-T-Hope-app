# John T Hope App

**Our honesty is integrity you can trust.**  
**The secure choice for creative and cultural transactions.**

## Platform Overview

This platform is a protected, professional ecosystem for DJs, venues, promoters, and cultural workers. It provides contract-based transactions, verified profiles, and built-in protection through a third-party insurer. Every agreement is treated with dignity, clarity, and cultural respect.

---

## Core Principles

### Honesty
We speak plainly and build transparently.

### Integrity
Every action, feature, and interaction reflects our values.

### Trust
Our infrastructure is designed to support safe, reliable agreements.

### Protection
Every eligible transaction includes Platform Protection, funded through the Platform Service Fee.

### Culture
We honour the people and practices that keep creative culture alive.

## Platform Protection (High-Level)

- Included automatically with eligible transactions
- Funded through the Platform Service Fee
- Delivered through a regulated third-party insurer
- Covers solicitor's fees when disputes cannot be resolved

**The platform is not an insurer and does not provide insurance advice.**
