## Development Standards
- Clean, intentional commits
- Atomic changes
- Clear documentation
- No silent logic
- Respect the brand voice in user-facing text

---

## Protection Logic
Developers must not:
- Provide legal advice
- Handle disputes manually
- Represent the platform as an insurer

All protection flows route to the third-party insurer.

---

## Contributing
1. Create a feature branch  
2. Write clear commits  
3. Open a PR with a structured description  
4. Request review  
5. Merge after approval
